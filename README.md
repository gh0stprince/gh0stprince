- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gh0stprince or Meloran. I'm primarily a visual artist, though I have a thing for webdev. I want to eventually get into hosting my own server once I get either a Raspberry Pi or an old Linux machine.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and how to develop Python scripts for Krita.
